### About

I'm a developer passionate about building scalable, high-performance user interfaces that merge technical excellence with exceptional user experiences. My favorite work happens at the intersection of frontend architecture and product innovation, crafting solutions that are meticulously engineered for both functionality and maintainability.

Currently, I'm a Lead Frontend Engineer at [Picsellia](https://www.picsellia.com/), specializing in the Vue.js ecosystem. I lead the frontend team in building a comprehensive MLOps platform for computer vision AI models, defining technical architecture and establishing best practices that ensure code quality and scalable development processes.

Throughout my career, I've developed software across diverse environments — from [space agency](https://cnes.fr) and [fintech scale-up](https://www.lyra.com) to innovative startups. This variety has deepened my expertise in Vue.js, TypeScript, and given me a comprehensive understanding of technical challenges across different industries.

In my spare time, you'll find me on the rugby pitch, improvising on stage at local theater groups, exploring underwater worlds with my Level 2 diving certification, or hanging out with my friends.
